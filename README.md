## How to tackle Deep Fakes?
### By identifying fake images from real ones, of course!
### Part 1:
> Convert image to grayscale
### Part 2:
> Check for Steganographic generated token/neural_id
### Part 3:
> Embed tokens
### Part 4:
> Run comparator and differential algorithms
### Part 5:
> Create End points for rapid distribution
